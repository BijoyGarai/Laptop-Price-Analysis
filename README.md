# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts laptop prices based on various features such as brand, processor type, RAM, SSD, GPU, etc. The goal was to understand price drivers and build a regression model for accurate predictions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Google Colab

## 📊 Key Steps
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering (Label Encoding, Log Transform)
- Model Building (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)
- Model Evaluation (R² Score, MSE)

## 🎯 Results
Achieved an R² score of 0.86 on test data. The model identifies key factors influencing price, such as brand and specifications.
